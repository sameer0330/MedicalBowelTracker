# MedicalBowelTracker
This is an app that can be used by patients having bowel problems to keep a track in an interactive way.
The app uses a calendar and events with a time associated with the event can be used to keep track.
It uses an SQLite database to store the events.
These are some of the snapshots of this unique but interestingly helpful app.
